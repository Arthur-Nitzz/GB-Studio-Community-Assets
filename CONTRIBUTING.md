# Contributing

If you want to contribute your own assets, all files must be original work, and usable in GB Studio. **Please do not upload content that you did not make.** All submissions fall under the MIT License. No credit required, assets can be used commercially. See LICENSE for more info.

If you need additional help having your assets added to the repository, or you're experiencing difficulties downloading/using any assets from this repository, [join the GB Studio Discord](https://discord.gg/2hYeJ4m).

## Filenames

Make sure the file you're adding has a unique and distinctive name.
If you're using a common name ("cactus", "apple", "dance") put a number at the end of it so others may use the same name.

**Good filename examples:**

- "short_cactus_1.png"
- "short_cactus_2.png"
- "husky_howling.mod"
- "wolf_howl_1.mod"
- "jennas_house.png"

**Bad filename examples:**

- "ascii.png"
- "plant.png"
- "background2.png
- "template.mod"
- "newsong.uge"

## Filetypes

No working files (.psd, .ai, .pdn, .gimp, .etc). Please only add .png images and .mod music files if you're submitting assets to be used. Don't make anybody else have to do the file-conversion process!
