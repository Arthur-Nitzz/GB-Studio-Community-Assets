## Downloading .mod music?

GB Studio may warn that certain music files are corrupted. This is only if you download the entire repository as a .zip (with the green download button). Github changes the line endings when compressing files, and this confuses GB Studio. There are many ways to get around this, such as:
- Opening the "corrupted" .mod file in OpenMPT and hitting Save (changes the line endings)
- Downloading the individual .mod file you want from here: [https://github.com/DeerTears/GB-Studio-Community-Assets/tree/master/Music](https://github.com/DeerTears/GB-Studio-Community-Assets/tree/master/Music)
- Cloning this repository using a Git client like [https://desktop.github.com/](https://desktop.github.com/)
- Downloading the GBSCA mirror on Mediafire: (coming soon)
