All assets must be original and usable in GB Studio. **Please do not upload content that you did not make.**

No attribution is required! All assets can be freely distributed and used commercially. If you're submitting your own work to this repo, you must be okay with it being used commercially and potentially redistributed without credit. Read the LICENCE file for more details.

# Downloading .mod music?

**Do not download the entire repository!** Instead, [click here to download a music-only .zip folder](https://github.com/DeerTears/GB-Studio-Community-Assets/releases/tag/v1.0) of this repository. Github changes line-endings when zipping a full repository, and this mismatch causes GBT Player to crash on compile. You can prevent this GBT Player crash by downloading the music release separately from the rest of the repository.

# How-To Credit

To help track our contributors, a README.md file exists for each folder. These README files contain the names of every asset creator, followed by a list of the assets they've made for that particular folder. If you use an asset from the repository, please read-up on who made the asset you've downloaded and pay it forward by including the asset-maker's name in your game's credits. :)

# How-To Contribute

[Read the CONTRIBUTING.MD file](https://github.com/DeerTears/GB-Studio-Community-Assets/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

If you need additional help having your assets added to the repository, or you're experiencing difficulties downloading/using any assets from this repository, [join the GB Studio Discord](https://discord.gg/2hYeJ4m).
